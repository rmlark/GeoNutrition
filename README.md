GeoNutrition Project codes and data extracts

This repository contains codes and data from the GeoNutrition Project, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) 
[INV-009129] and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) / Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) [BB/P023126/1]. 

These data were obtained from grain and soil samples, collected from farmers' fields and grain stores in Malawi and Ethiopia, with the farmers' informed consent.  The work was conducted under ethical approvals from the University of Nottingham, School of Sociology and Social Policy Research Ethics Committee (REC); BIO-1718-0004 and BIO-1819-001 for Ethiopia and Malawi, respectively. These REC approvals were recognised formally by the Directors of Research at Addis Ababa University (Ethiopia) and Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Malawi), who also reviewed the study protocols. Sampling was undertaken in November–December 2017 (most of Amhara Region, Ethiopia), November 2018–January 2019 (Amhara, Oromia, and Tigray Regions of Ethiopia) and in April–June 2018 (Malawi).

The folder Geostatistics_and_mapping contains data on micronutrient concentration in grains, and R code for their geostatistical analysis: exploratory analysis, variogram estimation, model-fitting, cross-validation and kriging.  The code is annotated.  At various points options are selected depending on whether the data under study are from Malawi or Ethiopia.

The folder Soil_Crop_comparisons contains code for the fitting of linear mixed models to investigate relationships between grain micronutrient concentrations and some key soil properties.
